# Bulk-NSlookup
This tool was created out of a need to do very fast lookups of certain records on multiple domains.  
We read the list of domains out of the DNS.txt file and drop the results in the nslookup.txt file.

It's not bullet-proof, but it works well.  Maybe sometime in the near future I will refine it some more...
